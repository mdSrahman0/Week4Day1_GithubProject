# Week4Day1_GithubProject

NOTE - ONLY PROBLEM 1 is complete.

Create an application with two screens

Screen one: should have your Github profile. Use at least 4 fields from the response to update the views.

Screen 2: Populate the recyclerView with the repositories you get from your profile. Use at least 3 fields in each item view.

This is the screen the user is greeted with. It will populate with my Github information upon startup
